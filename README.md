# Final Project- Interactive Graphics and Critical Code

## Project: MusicVis

### Conceptual Description

My piece will be an unconventional perspective on music data. I hope to synthesize information about how songs are reviewed, the content of their lyrics and the technical details of the audio. I hope to provide a way to better understand the music and its behaviors through sight (and simpler sounds) rather than by just listening to the songs. I am engaging with topics including sentiment analysis and how well emotions in music conveyed through sound and words can be distilled by algorithms into a relative score, music reviews and what kind of sonic features affect it. Viewers should take away a refined and more thoughtful and aware perspective about the music they listen to every day, what the lyrics are conveying and how other people convey their own emotions about it.

### Interaction Description

Each of my visualizations of the different parts of the data have a different interactive element, whether that be toggling/viewing a different side of the data or tapping different icons (in the polarity vis) to see how they move and what that conveys about that song. I also have incorporated audio interaction as well, engaging with users' sense of hearing in a more simplistic way that conveys information on the average speechiness of the rating in question. I also intend to possibly add speech or webcam engagement for further connection to the user to ask more questions about these songs.

In the space, I see it being displayed openly for each separate user to interact with as they please. Users will be free to click through different visualizations and experience each of them. I intend for the audience to be anyone who is engaged and interested in listening to music and quantifying the experience to some extent, understanding and how it it evokes different emotions in different people. Interaction will expose and bring out the full extent of the data being conveyed and will possibly help them make more sense of the trends and behaviors by toggling through different aspects of the data and comparing/contrasting them.

### Extension 

Do you intend to extend a piece that you've created throughout the semester? What elements are you adding or subtracting from the previous piece? How do these extensions/subtractions further develop the conceptual and interactive elements of your work?

I am extending and adjusting my previous music visualization piece. I hope to unify/clean up the design scheme. I hope to add a scene manager introduction and possible guide through overarching takeaways/themes I have gauged from working with the data. I also hope to add new visualization sections that involve popularity stats, and possibly others that may involve speaking words or lyrics into the sketch or typing. I hope that this will help provide more cohesion and guidance to the concept, more fluidly allowing useful information to be obtained through varying methods of interaction. I may also investigate if there are any extraneous features or points of interaction that do not add or more confuse than clarify aspects of the data that can be removed.
